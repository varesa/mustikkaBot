MustikkaBot
===========

Language: Python
Author: Esa Varemo

MustikkaBot is an twitch/IRC chat bot that I created for my friend who uses the nickname HerraMustikka in twitch. It is created to overcome some limitations of other known bots such as moobot, and for me to learn something. It is designed to be modular, as in you can throw in "modules" that add functionality on the fly and it dynamically would load them.
